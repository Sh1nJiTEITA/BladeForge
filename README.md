# Why?

This program is being developed for the computer-aided design of turbine blades.

# TODO List
- Add vertices input/output. Vertex output should be used for next steps in analysis. Input vertices should be used as stencil for designing new blades;
- Add multiple viewports for each blade section & 3D blade shape;
- Add swap blade bar for switching between;
- Add scripting language for configs. Priorities: Lua, Python or simple json-file parsing mechanism;
- Find and add external camera class;
- Add screenshoting for ready blades;
- Add line sizes;
- Add smart (toolbox) object-picking.
